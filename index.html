			Introduction
		</h3>

		<p>ME3Explorer is a fan-built toolset used to mod Mass Effect 3. With a combination of over 50 unique tools, a large part of the game may be edited. 
		Meshes, textures and audio can be extracted, edited, and in some cases, added. Objects and levels can be edited/created/moved to a certain degree. 
		Almost every aspect of cutscene conversations can be altered from dialogue to camerawork, to adding new matinee tracks. 
		A wide variety of story changes can be made including adding new codices, emails, war assets, achievements, and even entire new systems to the galaxy map.
		</p>
		<p>
		ME3Explorer also contains a small limted number of tools for Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2. 
		These tools primarily focus on the ability to extract and apply new textures, but are in the process of expanding.</p>

		<p>The toolset isn't just meant for mod creators. Players may utilize ME3Explorer with the .mod and .tpf files on various sites to apply changes to their game files. 
		The new "DLC mods" should also be used with various ME3Explorer tools to ensure the game reads the new DLC files properly.</p>

			BioWare's Stance on Modding
		</h3>

		<p>BioWare's stance on modding Mass Effect is dependent upon campaign type. No action will be taken against players who mod single-player content, 
		but they do so at their own risk. However, modding multi-player can be a bannable offense if the mod gives the player an unfair advantage. 
		Players who choose to mod these files must do so with extreme caution..</p>

			Choosing your Download Type | Stable or Beta
		</h3>

		<p>Most toolset users should stick to the stable release of ME3Explorer, hosted on Nexusmods. The stable release will lack the most recent changes to the code, 
		but has been more thoroughly tested and will have fewer bugs.</p>
		<p>
		Toolset developers and mod creators who want to have access to the latest changes, and advanced users who wish to help with testing the toolset, 
		should use the latest beta release, hosted here on GitHub. 
		Just click the "Latest Beta" button to the left and you'll be directed to the proper download.
		</p>

			Contributing
		</h3>

		<p>As with the community, the toolset is ever evolving, and always in need of more developers. If you're interested in helping out, please head over to the forums and say hello! 
		Source code is available here on github, but can be a bit intimidating if you're just starting out. Be sure to get in touch with an active developer for an introduction.
